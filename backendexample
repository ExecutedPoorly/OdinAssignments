The server. This is the computer that receives requests.

The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.

The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data.

An API is a collection of clearly defined methods of communication between different software components.

GET describes the kind of request (the client is just asking for data.
The URI (uniform resource identifier) /products/66432 specifies that the client is looking for more information about a product, and that product, has an id of 66432.

Event listeners that match this request (the HTTP verb: GET, and the URI: /products/66432) are triggered. The code that runs on the server between the request and the response is called middleware.


Examples of backend processes include:
processing an incoming webpage request
running a script (PHP, ASP, JSP, etc.) to generate HTML
accessing data, such as an article, from a database using an SQL queries
storing or updating records in a database
encrypting and decrypting data
handling file uploads and downloads
processing user input via JavaScript
